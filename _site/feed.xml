&lt;p&gt;The majority of people included in both large-scale studies of human genetic variation and clinical trials are of European ancestry. Programs such as the NIH’s “All of Us” research program propose to remedy this reality by announcing a commitment to recruit participants from members of underrepresented minority populations in order to promote “equal enjoyment of the future benefits of precision medicine.” While seemingly a laudable goal, data from large-scale human genome sequencing efforts (including International HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes Project) have been commodified in the past (for example, the open access to data on population-specific biomarkers has led to pharmaceutical companies generating nearly a billion dollars in profits—and the high price of the resulting drugs often make them inaccessible to patients in  study populations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, indigenous peoples are concerned about the potential for commodification of drugs derived from research on their genomes. If programs like “All of Us” wish to recruit Indigenous-community members, Indigenous people should be included in the development of policies concerning data access, data use, and intellectual property. Approaches for ensuring that Indigenous people have control of data from Indigenous populations are “indiviudal-interest models” which involve fractional ownership of stock, and collective-interest models (which involve community trusts, which provide subsidized access to drugs and reinvest in communities that participate in genomic research.). Equity and inclusion should be more than just buzzwords when considering the impact of advances in medicine driven by genomics—we also need to ensure that there are policies in place so that people from which research data is being derived from benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The early days of eugenics by Tommer Schwarz</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/28/september2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The early days of eugenics by Tommer Schwarz" /><published>2020-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/09/28/september2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/09/28/september2.html">&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was pointed out in our previous newsletter, Francis Galton is largely credited for the founding of behavioral genetics research. However, Galton is probably more well known for coining the term “eugenics” in the late 1800’s, and being one of its first supporters. Galton wrote that … “What nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly; man may do providently, quickly, and kindly. As it lies within his power, so it becomes his duty to work in that direction,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1912, the first International Conference on Eugenics was hosted in London, attended by Winston Churchill, Alexander Graham Bell, Charles Eliot (president of Harvard at the time), and many other figures from a variety of disciplines. There were two presentations that were good indicators of what state eugenics was at, and where it was heading. The first was given by a German physician named Alfred Ploetz, who spoke about “race-hygiene” and launching a racial-cleansing effort in Germany. And something to note here – this is 20 years before the start of WW2. But at that point, Ploetz was presenting his endorsement for the Germans’ plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stands in contrast to the second presentation, which put forth concrete plans of how to put eugenics into practice. Bleecke Van Wagenen, the president of the American Breeders’ Association, spoke about what efforts to eliminate “defective strains” in the United States would actually look like. He would go on to make some appalling statements, saying that “… Nearly ten percent of the total population are of inferior blood … they are totally unfitted to become the parents of useful citizens… in eight of the states of the union, there are laws authorizing or requiring sterilization…. Pennsylvania, Kansas, Idaho, Virginia … there have been sterilized a considerable number of individuals …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1920’s, a landmark case in eugenics reached the United States Supreme Court. The case involved Emma Buck , who had been sent to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded after rumors surfaced that she had had sex for money. Her daughter, Carrie Buck, was abused by her foster parents, eventually receiving a diagnosis of “feeblemindedness”, and in 1924, was sent to the Virginia State Colony, as well. That year, the commonwealth of Virginia passed a law authorizing the forced sterilization of “intellectually disabled” individuals, for the purpose of eugenics. To test how this law would hold up in practice, the superintendent of the Virginia State Colony filed a petition to sterilize Carrie Buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1927, after several rulings against Buck and several appeals, the case reached the United States Supreme Court, Buck v Bell. In an 8-1 decision, the court ruled that Virginia’s sterilization laws were legitimate, and that it was in the state’s best interest to have Buck sterilized. The ruling, written by judge Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who was considered to be one of the nation’s most vocal advocates of judicial moderation, wrote that “… three generations of imbeciles is enough,” Buck was sterilized on October 19, 1927.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contribution of genetics to intelligence has been studied since at
least the 19th century when &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.jrank.org/pages/267/Sir-Francis-Galton.html&quot;&gt;Francis Galton&lt;/a&gt;
popularized studying the heritability of behavioral traits. With the
invention of low-cost genetic tests and the growing size of biobanks,
rigorous scientific research on the genetic origin of intelligence has
flourished in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3817931/&quot;&gt;Landmark&lt;/a&gt; twin
studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries were the first to
elucidate the role of genetics in intelligence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=3D10.1037%2F0003-066X.51.2.77&quot;&gt;These&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/neu.10160&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; estimate the
heritability of intelligence between 50 and 70% (for context, the
heritability of height is estimated to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01157-y#:~:text=3DFor%20height%=
2C%20Visscher%20and%20colleagues,environmental%20factors%2C%20such%20as%20n=
utrition.&quot;&gt;~80%).&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2014105&quot;&gt;Some
more recent&lt;/a&gt; estimates even
suggest that the heritability may be closer to 80%. Interestingly, some
twin studies have purported to show what is now referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;lt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/a=
rticle/wilson-effect-the-increase-in-heritability-of-iq-with-age/FF406CC4CF=
286D78AF72C9E7EF9B5E3F&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;Wilson
Effect&lt;/a&gt;,
where the heritability of intelligence about 20% in infancy, but increases
to 80% in adulthood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919929/&quot;&gt;A particular strength of twin studies&lt;/a&gt; is their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411885&quot;&gt;perceived&lt;/a&gt; ability to control
for any environmental differences, which has long been considered the
primary factor in determining intelligence. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/IQ_Correlations.html&quot;&gt;twin studies have
estimated&lt;/a&gt; that
adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than random individuals but
that biological siblings=E2=80=99 IQs are correlated (average R2 ~0.5). Tog=
ether,
these studies were the first evidence that intelligence is strongly
controlled by genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern work has transitioned from twin studies to the GWAS. Intelligence
GWASes typically do not measure IQ, as did the twin studies, but
educational attainment, which has been shown to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615000355#:~=
:text=3DThey%20found%20a%20positive%20correlation%20between%20years%20of%20=
schooling%20and%20IQ%20scores.&amp;amp;text=3DPeople%20with%20higher%20educational%=
20levels,(g)%20may%20be%20different.&quot;&gt;highly correlated with I=
Q&lt;/a&gt;.
This switch is because IQ is expensive and time-consuming to measure, but
educational attainment is a standard demographic question in many biobanks.
Overall, GWAS studies have failed to find the same level of heritability
that twin studies have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393768/&quot;&gt;The most recent 1.1 million person GWAS&lt;/a&gt; estimated SNP-based
heritability at 0.3% and found that polygenic scores explained between
10-13% of the variance in educational attainment. Importantly, these
polygenic scores did not translate well to African Americans, which
explained only 6% of the variance in educational attainment in this
population. Additionally, the performance of the polygenic score in this
paper was lower than predictions based on parental socioeconomic status.
Educational attainment GWASes may be underpowered to find the same level of
heritability as twin studies, but overall indicate the highly polygenic
nature of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may also be substantial drawbacks to the way we are understanding and
studying intelligence. Firstly, both twin studies and GWAS may not
adequately control for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/assortative-mating&quot;&gt;assortative mating&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, it is
a strong assumption that the environment does not vary between even the
closest monozygotic twins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=3D10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77&quot;&gt;Even within one household&lt;/a&gt;, siblings
will be exposed to different trama and social experiences that can have
lasting impacts on intelligence. Additionally, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4440732/&quot;&gt;maternal in-utero
environment&lt;/a&gt; is a
largely unstudied environment that can have a long-term effect on human
development. Lastly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/424&quot;&gt;“nature of nurture”&lt;/a&gt;, or the argument that
your parent’s non-transmitted alleles strongly affect your environm=
ent,
could offer an explanation for the high heritability observed in twin
studies that are not recapitulated in polygenic scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both educational attainment and GWAS also rely on measures of testing that
may not be indicative of actual intelligence. For example, performance on
IQ tests may be biased by socioeconomic status or &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073191105276674&quot;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly,
educational attainment is known to vary widely by opportunity and ability
to pay: master’s programs (which would represent additional educati=
onal
attainment) are notoriously expensive in the US. Even heritability
estimates have been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x&quot;&gt;vary between socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;. In
short, education and intelligence measurements are nearly impossible to
separate from the environment, emphasizing the need to make careful and
precise conclusions in the interpretation of a study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to note that the study of the genetics of
intelligence should always be considered in light of its social
implications. The field has always been controversial. &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3D1270&amp;amp;context=
=3Dlaw-review&quot;&gt;Nazi eugenicists
were among the first to devise IQ tests&lt;/a&gt;
and more recently, the American alt-right has utilized claims about the
genetic basis of intelligence to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard=
-lynn&quot;&gt;justify their belief in white supremacy&lt;/a&gt;.
Beyond the political, the genetic control of intelligence is unsettling
because it provides a stage for the nature vs nurture debate. The
implications of this debate can challenge our understanding of what it
means to be human and what it means to create an equitable society. While
there Something of this importance requires thoughtful and thorough
science.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SUMMARY by Albert Xue</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/31/august2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SUMMARY by Albert Xue" /><published>2020-08-31T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-08-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/31/august2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/31/august2.html">&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint to Elaine’s summary, I thought it would be interesting to read about a specific interaction between race and medicine. I chose this &lt;a href=&quot;https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3372911/Brandt_Racism.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, a 1978 review of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study that highlighted how a foundation of eugenic thought and Social Darwinism in medicine allowed for a thirty-year-long medical exploitation of African-Americans that only ended in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study’s beginnings (~1929), African-Americans were cast as overly sexual and “primitive” who were both especially prone to sexually transmitted diseases and would, due to personality factors, be unwilling to seek treatment for STDs. As a result, African-Americans were seen as perfect subjects in which to observe the long-term effects of untreated syphilis despite the prevailing opinion that treatment “markedly diminishes the risk of syphilis”; in fact, the same doctor who noted that “treatment markedly diminishes the risk of syphilis” and slows the progression of the disease also pushed the Tuskegee study forwards, calling the study “of immense value”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjects were recruited from Macon County, Alabama, which had been previously noted to have a high rate of syphilis. However, the canvassers had difficulties finding willing subjects; in fact, they were only able to obtain cooperation with the offer of treatment (contradicting the idea that African-Americans would not be inclined to seek treatment for syphilis) and in doing so found overall rates of syphilis to be well below expectation. However, experimenters had no intention of treating the men; subjects were given drugs known to be noneffective and were simply observed to understand the long-term effects of syphilis. Even when penicillin became widely available as the preferred syphilis treatment by the early 1950s, none of the subjects were given penicillin, and over thirty years none of the men were ever given syphilitic treatment. By the time the study ended in 1972, at least twenty-eight, but possibly over 100, had died directly from advanced syphilitic lesions; seventy-four of the test subjects were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the Tuskegee Syphilis Study represents a counterexample to the idea of value-free science, highlighted a “need for greater vigilance in assessing the specific ways in which social values and attitudes affect professional behavior”, and served as a direct cause of mistrust of both government and medicine in the African-American community today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Complicated relationship between race and medicine by Elaine Huang</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/15/august1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Complicated relationship between race and medicine by Elaine Huang" /><published>2020-08-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-08-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/08/15/august1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/08/15/august1.html">&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race is often used as a rough proxy for inferring genomic variation that
may affect drug response. Though several studies note that self-identified
race correlates with geographical ancestry (which is a determinant of
genomic variations that can affect drug reaction–e.g. 10% of people=
 have a
mutation in CYP2D6 that makes the pain medication codeine nearly/completely
ineffective), there are some dangers to this practice. Not only does it
potentially reinforce the view that there are biological differences
underlying social definitions of race (which can be used to motivate racial
discrimination), but it also may cause doctors to overlook potentially
helpful drug treatments for individual patients. For example, due to
frequent reports (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11333991/&quot;&gt;Exner et al. 2001&lt;/a&gt;) that ACE inhibitors are less
effective in black patients, physicians are less likely to prescribe them
to these individuals. This may prevent individual patients whose
hypertension would have responded well to ACE inhibitors from receiving
them. Subsequent studies have shown that when adequate dosing and
appropriate combinations are used, ACE inhibitors are equally effective in
both black and white patients (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12556668/&quot;&gt;Saunders and Gavin 2003&lt;/a&gt;).
Furthermore, self-identified race does not always correlate with ancestry
as well as we’d expect. in one report, while individuals who self-r=
eported
as white had on average less than 10% African ancestry; those who
self-reported as black had a much wider variance in background–a
significant number of individuals had less than 10% African ancestry (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3D1&amp;amp;v=3DLAWrwexw-To&amp;amp;feature=3D=
emb_logo&quot;&gt;TED
talk&lt;/a&gt;,
mentions study from NEJM around 7:50). Precision/personalized medicine,
which involves using personal data (e.g. environment, lifestyle, and
genomic variation) to prescribe treatments could reduce the use of
self-reported race in drug prescribing, but there are challenges that must
be overcome before it can be implemented/accessible widely. One of these
challenges involves recruiting more diverse cohorts for studies on how
genetic makeup impacts drug response–and with our current lack of knowledge
about what exactly the relevant variants to look for are, we may have to
use self-reported race as a proxy for defining diversity (even though using
it as a variable is something we’re trying to reduce in drug prescr=
ibing)
(this last sentence is how I’m interpreting the conclusion of Bonha=
m et
al.).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
