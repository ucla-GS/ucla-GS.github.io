title: Genetic Control of Intelligence by Christa Caggiano

<!--excerpt-->
The contribution of genetics to intelligence has been studied since at
least the 19th century when [Francis Galton](https://psychology.jrank.org/pages/267/Sir-Francis-Galton.html)
popularized studying the heritability of behavioral traits. With the
invention of low-cost genetic tests and the growing size of biobanks,
rigorous scientific research on the genetic origin of intelligence has
flourished in recent years.

[Landmark](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3817931/) twin
studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries were the first to
elucidate the role of genetics in intelligence. [These](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=3D10.1037%2F0003-066X.51.2.77) [studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/neu.10160) estimate the
heritability of intelligence between 50 and 70% (for context, the
heritability of height is estimated to be [~80%).](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01157-y#:~:text=3DFor%20height%=
2C%20Visscher%20and%20colleagues,environmental%20factors%2C%20such%20as%20n=
utrition.)
[Some
more recent](<https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2014105>) estimates even
suggest that the heritability may be closer to 80%. Interestingly, some
twin studies have purported to show what is now referred to as the [Wilson
Effect](<https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/a=
rticle/wilson-effect-the-increase-in-heritability-of-iq-with-age/FF406CC4CF=
286D78AF72C9E7EF9B5E3F>),
where the heritability of intelligence about 20% in infancy, but increases
to 80% in adulthood. [A particular strength of twin studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919929/) is their [perceived](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411885) ability to control
for any environmental differences, which has long been considered the
primary factor in determining intelligence. For example, [twin studies have
estimated](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/IQ_Correlations.html) that
adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than random individuals but
that biological siblings=E2=80=99 IQs are correlated (average R2 ~0.5). Tog=
ether,
these studies were the first evidence that intelligence is strongly
controlled by genetics.

Modern work has transitioned from twin studies to the GWAS. Intelligence
GWASes typically do not measure IQ, as did the twin studies, but
educational attainment, which has been shown to be [highly correlated with I=
Q](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615000355#:~=
:text=3DThey%20found%20a%20positive%20correlation%20between%20years%20of%20=
schooling%20and%20IQ%20scores.&text=3DPeople%20with%20higher%20educational%=
20levels,(g)%20may%20be%20different.).
This switch is because IQ is expensive and time-consuming to measure, but
educational attainment is a standard demographic question in many biobanks.
Overall, GWAS studies have failed to find the same level of heritability
that twin studies have. [The most recent 1.1 million person GWAS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393768/) estimated SNP-based
heritability at 0.3% and found that polygenic scores explained between
10-13% of the variance in educational attainment. Importantly, these
polygenic scores did not translate well to African Americans, which
explained only 6% of the variance in educational attainment in this
population. Additionally, the performance of the polygenic score in this
paper was lower than predictions based on parental socioeconomic status.
Educational attainment GWASes may be underpowered to find the same level of
heritability as twin studies, but overall indicate the highly polygenic
nature of intelligence.

There may also be substantial drawbacks to the way we are understanding and
studying intelligence. Firstly, both twin studies and GWAS may not
adequately control for [assortative mating](https://www.britannica.com/science/assortative-mating). Furthermore, it is
a strong assumption that the environment does not vary between even the
closest monozygotic twins. [Even within one household](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=3D10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77), siblings
will be exposed to different trama and social experiences that can have
lasting impacts on intelligence. Additionally, the [maternal in-utero
environment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4440732/) is a
largely unstudied environment that can have a long-term effect on human
development. Lastly, the ["nature of nurture"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/424), or the argument that
your parent's non-transmitted alleles strongly affect your environm=
ent,
could offer an explanation for the high heritability observed in twin
studies that are not recapitulated in polygenic scores.


Both educational attainment and GWAS also rely on measures of testing that
may not be indicative of actual intelligence. For example, performance on
IQ tests may be biased by socioeconomic status or [culture](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073191105276674). Similarly,
educational attainment is known to vary widely by opportunity and ability
to pay: master's programs (which would represent additional educati=
onal
attainment) are notoriously expensive in the US. Even heritability
estimates have been shown to [vary between socioeconomic status](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x). In
short, education and intelligence measurements are nearly impossible to
separate from the environment, emphasizing the need to make careful and
precise conclusions in the interpretation of a study.

Finally, it is important to note that the study of the genetics of
intelligence should always be considered in light of its social
implications. The field has always been controversial. [Nazi eugenicists
were among the first to devise IQ tests](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3D1270&context=
=3Dlaw-review)
and more recently, the American alt-right has utilized claims about the
genetic basis of intelligence to [justify their belief in white supremacy](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard=
-lynn).
Beyond the political, the genetic control of intelligence is unsettling
because it provides a stage for the nature vs nurture debate. The
implications of this debate can challenge our understanding of what it
means to be human and what it means to create an equitable society. While
there Something of this importance requires thoughtful and thorough
science.
