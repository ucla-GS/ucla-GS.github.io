title: The Illusion of Inclusion — The “All of Us” Research Program and Indigenous Peoples’ DNA by Keolu Fox (article summarized by Elaine Huang)

<!--excerpt-->

The majority of people included in both large-scale studies of human genetic variation and clinical trials are of European ancestry. Programs such as the NIH’s “All of Us” research program propose to remedy this reality by announcing a commitment to recruit participants from members of underrepresented minority populations in order to promote “equal enjoyment of the future benefits of precision medicine.” While seemingly a laudable goal, data from large-scale human genome sequencing efforts (including International HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes Project) have been commodified in the past (for example, the open access to data on population-specific biomarkers has led to pharmaceutical companies generating nearly a billion dollars in profits—and the high price of the resulting drugs often make them inaccessible to patients in  study populations). 

In particular, indigenous peoples are concerned about the potential for commodification of drugs derived from research on their genomes. If programs like "All of Us" wish to recruit Indigenous-community members, Indigenous people should be included in the development of policies concerning data access, data use, and intellectual property. Approaches for ensuring that Indigenous people have control of data from Indigenous populations are “indiviudal-interest models” which involve fractional ownership of stock, and collective-interest models (which involve community trusts, which provide subsidized access to drugs and reinvest in communities that participate in genomic research.). Equity and inclusion should be more than just buzzwords when considering the impact of advances in medicine driven by genomics—we also need to ensure that there are policies in place so that people from which research data is being derived from benefit.
