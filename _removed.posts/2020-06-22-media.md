title: Media Consumption - Update 2
---
<!--excerpt-->
**Current:**   

  * *Grey's Anatomy* (Netflix) - very bingeable 
  * *It's Okay Not to Be Okay* (Netflix K-drama)
  * *Avatar: The Last Airbender* - gotta understand all the memes
  * *Tropic of Orange* - Karen Tei Yamashita - honestly kind of a bit lost
  * *Superior: The Return of Race Science* (by Angela Saini)
 
**Consumed, worth noting:**    
  * *Thelma & Louise* (last movie night in old apartment)
  * *Okja* (colorfully bizarre, Studio Ghilbi meets Hollywood, fell asleep for part of it but prob. not causal)
  * *Dead Poets Society* (young Wilson from *House*)
  * *Big Little Lies* (HBO show set in beautiful Monterey, California - really nice colors)
  * *13 going on 30* (...very 2000s)
  * *You Are the Apple of my Eye* (Taiwanese movie, high school comedy romance)
  * *Silicon Valley* (HBO show) - apparently a lot of people don't enjoy the later seasons as much, but I consistently enjoyed the entire thing
  * *Lobster* - dry humor comedy about a dystopian future in which you have 40 days to find love or you turn into an animal
  * *Never Have I Ever* - I realize I'm a sucker for bad teenage TV shows/movies
  * *Love, Simon* - See above.
  * *Gook* - (directed by Justin Chon, friendship between two Korean-American brothers and neighborhood black girl) - my roommate said it reminded her of a film student's senior thesis, but not entirely in a bad way. I did fall asleep for part of it, but it seemed artfully done? Black and white. 

**For the Future:**
  * *Utopia Avenue* (new novel by David Mitchell)
  * *The Grand Budapest Hotel* (or any Wes Anderson film, really)
  * *Snowpiercer* (film directed by Bong Joon-ho) 
  * *Exhalation* (short story collection by Ted Chiang)
  * *The Paper Menegerie* (short story collection by Ken Liu)
  * *Sense8* (Netflix show, David Mitchell helped write the second season)
  * *Up in the Air* (movie) 
  * *The Good Place* (Netflix show)
  * *Witcher* (suggested by high school friend)
  * *Superior: The Return of Race Science* (by Angela Saini)
  * FOR LEARNING ABOUT 1992 LA RIOTS: 
      * *Do the Right Thing* (directed by Spike Lee, highlights tension between African-American and Korean-American communities)
      * *Sa-I-Gu* (1993 documentary about the koreatown riots directed by Dai Sil Kim-Gibson)
  * *Shutter Island*
  * *What Time is it there* (artsy Taiwanese movie)
  * *Pi* (artsy French film)
  * *A Whisker Away* (Netflix anime movie)
  * *Sleepless in Seattle*
  * *Little Fires Everywhere*

**Technically still in-progress, but more like it's on hold**
  * *House, M.D.* (Amazon prime show)
  * *The Gene: An Intimiate History* (book by Siddhartha Mukherjee)
  * *It must've been something I ate* (collection of food essays by Jeffrey Steingarten)
