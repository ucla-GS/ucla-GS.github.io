The purpose of the discussion group would be for us to learn more about topics related to societal impacts (both historic and present) of our research (e.g. understanding of race vs. ancestry, racial biases in algorithms, inclusivity in STEM, etc.). More topics [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVy-Tw1Pok0tsLsIm-tFBqivFiXEWiIqHnhjjh0a7Vg/edit?usp=sharing)

I am hoping this can function as a way for people to learn more about these topics just by reading a short email every 2 weeks and occasionally summarizing an article for the rest of the group. 



*FORMAT*

Week 1: I contact two people to be the summarizers for that month and we decide on a general topic (e.g. "Race and Medicine")
Week 2: By Friday evening, Summarizer 1 emails me a summary of their article, which I can then distribute to the entire group (to avoid summarizers needing to keep track of who is currently on the mailing list) the following Monday. 
Week 3: Break
Week 4: Same as Week 2, but for Summarizer 2.
